    <p>American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle;
        indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created
        around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.</p>
