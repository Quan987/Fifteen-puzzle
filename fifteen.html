	<h1> Fifteen Puzzle </h1>

	<p> The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares by repeatedly making moves that slide squares 
	into the empty space. How quickly can you solve it? </p>

<p> American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle; 
indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle 
was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York. </p>
